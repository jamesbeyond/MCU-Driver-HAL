/* mbed OS boot sequence
 *
 * Most of mbed supported targets use default ARM Cortex M boot approach, where the core starts executing reset vector
 * after power up. Reset ISR is defined for each target by the vendor (basing on CMSIS template). Reset vector is
 * responsible for low level platform init and then calling in libc (__main). Depending on compiler and version of C
 * library, predefined function will be called which is implemented by mbed OS.
 *
 * There's number of functions, vendor and users can provide to setup the platform and/or inject a code to be executed
 *  before main():
 *      * Reset vector and SystemInit: Reset vector should do low level core and board initialization.
 *      * mbed_sdk_init: Higher level board init and making sure the board is ready for the mbed OS.
 *      * mbed_main: User's code to be executed before main().
 *      * main: Standard application code.
 *
 * Other notes:
 *
 *    * In addition to the above, libc will use functions defined in mbed_boot.c: __rtos_malloc_lock/unlock,
 *      __rtos_env_lock/unlock.
 *
 *    * First step after the execution is passed to mbed, software_init_hook for GCC and __rt_entry for ARMC is to
 *      initialize heap.
 *
 * Memory layout notes:
 * ====================
 *
 * IAR Memory layout :
 * - Heap defined by "HEAP" region in .icf file
 * - Interrupt stack defined by "CSTACK" region in .icf file
 * - Value INITIAL_SP is ignored
 *
 * GCC Memory layout :
 * - Heap explicitly placed in linker script (*.ld file) and heap start (__end___) and heap end (__HeapLimit) should be
 * defined in linker script
 * - Interrupt stack placed in linker script **.ld file) and stack start (__StackTop) and stack end (__StackLimit)
 * should be defined in linker script
 *
 * ARM Memory layout :
 * - Heap can be explicitly placed by adding ARM_LIB_HEAP section in scatter file and defining both HEAP_START and
 * HEAP_SIZE
 * - Interrupt stack placed in scatter files (*.sct) by adding ARM_LIB_STACK section
 *
