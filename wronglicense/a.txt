/* TODO:

   Make sure all relevant comments, and all relevant code from all
   actions, brought over from old parser.  Verify exact correspondence
   of syntax accepted.

   Add testcases covering every input symbol in every state in old and
   new parsers.

   Include full syntax for GNU C, including erroneous cases accepted
   with error messages, in syntax productions in comments.

   Make more diagnostics in the front end generally take an explicit
   location rather than implicitly using input_location.  */
